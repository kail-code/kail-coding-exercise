# Part I

API Routes
Endpoint to receive patient's answers and recommend appropriate assessements.
For the API, I'd like to add an end point to assess answers to a questionaire. The tech stack should be Node/Express/NestJS and Typescript.
`api/assess`

For storing of the domain hash, I thought using a database would be overkill in this scenario since there is not a need for a database persistence in either part of the excercise. So, I chose to use file storage.
`domains.json`

error handling

Inputs - answers to the questionaire with scoring
Outputs - which assessments are recommended for this patient

# Part II

Add to the API Routes
`api/screener`

Build a UI to show the questions using React/Typescript functional components.
Add analytics
Add test coverage
Store data in the format that the `api/assess` end point needs
